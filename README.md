Branch trying to fix issue with Shaders

Changelog

Model Loading is now fixed you just have to put the assimp.dll into the x64\Debug File unsure why this fixes the issue but work till now.
The Dev file now only includes the lib files for assimp and GLFW3 as you should have your our own versions installed via vcpkg.
