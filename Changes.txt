3D Engine Mark2 1.1 Changes;


--------------------

Game object now used to hold all Entites for single draw, so any object made must first be inserted into EntityList vector for objects and HudList for Sprits and HudElements;
clean up of code to make it slighty more cohereant;
Made it so that the hud texture can be changed via rightclicking to a transparent texture;
Transparent Textures working;


-----Issues----
Cant get textures to apply to cube if you know how to fix all relevant data can be found in object3d.cpp;


-----To Do--------

Assimp integration
Bullet Physics
Camera

---Possible To Do---
Rewrite Sprite and Object3D and all relevant entities to inherit from an entity base class this might make colisions easier.
